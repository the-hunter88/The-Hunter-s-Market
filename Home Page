      <h3>Restaurant</h3>
      <p>The restaurant is a very conforting and the service is great. The chef cooks the food that is brought in from that day and prepares it for one of, if not, the best experiences of eating what you have caught or harvested.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4">
      <h3>Guide Service</h3>
      <p>We use a guide service that their customers stay at the lodge and the resturant cooks what they have harvested for the day. The guide services are to go out and either harvest the local wildgame, or whatever is in season, or to go out can catch the local fish that we have. If you do not get something for that day then do not worry because we will always serve you with other nonlocal wildgame that you certainly enjoy.</p>
